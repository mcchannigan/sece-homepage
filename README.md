The SECE home page houses links and contact info for each UH campus, announcements, and links to various resources for students, UH employers, and non-UH employers. This app loads campus info, announcements, and links via REST API from the SECE database, allowing for dynamic updates without the need to manually edit HTML.

## API

The API endpoint is configured in the .env (for production) and .env.development (for development) files. The API endpoints are implemented in the 2024-01-11_homepage-api branch on the SECE SVN repository (See HomeApiController class). The development environment assumes that there is a local instance of tomcat running the SECE application at localhost:8443/sece.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
